## My code Basic steps.

# Copying files from lonestar backup

# a) zip and send to cds
tar -cvf hydra_data_structure.tar ../../../../../corral-repl/utexas/A-bio7/AG3C/backup/data/experiments/glucose_time_course/sample*/RNA/
# b) unzip
tar -xvf hydra_data_structure.tar

mv data/corral_repl/utexas/A-bio7/AG3C/backup/data/experiments/*.* data/
# get rid of additional folders by using FZ

# get rid of processed data and non depleted data (we do not need them)
tacc:/scratch/03221/ucaglar/data$ rm -rf glucose_time_course/samp*/RNA/*.processed
tacc:/scratch/03221/ucaglar/data$ rm -rf glucose_time_course/samp*/RNA/non_*.*

so at this point I have a file that looks like original data set with only raw RNA data.
data is under $SCRATCH/data
it might look like 
/scratch/03221/ucaglar/data/glucose_time_course/sample100/RNA/depleted.raw/
the code is under $HOME/Ecoli_RNAseq
I add a folder under $SCRATCH/data named runningCenter I run all commands from there which causes all .e .o .pe files appear under there which prevents mess

to be able to run flexbar
you should download the flexbar also
note flexbar ver 2.31 works fine on the other hand ver 2.5 does not work
 
the next step is to generate the file list for combining all the data files under processed folder

for this we need a list of files that incldes list of all the files that needs to be combined.

go to home directory
cd $HOME/Ecoli_RNAseq/src
be sure that write_paramlist_concatenate02.sh have the permission to run; if so then run it; type 
./write_paramlist_concatenate02.sh

if everything goes well you should see numbers from 1 .. something
then it should generate a file named "paramlist_concatenate" under $SCRATCH/data that looks like

...
python /home1/03221/ucaglar/Ecoli_RNAseq/src/concatenate_reads.py /scratch/03221/ucaglar/data/glucose_time_course/sample100/RNA/depleted.raw/
python /home1/03221/ucaglar/Ecoli_RNAseq/src/concatenate_reads.py /scratch/03221/ucaglar/data/glucose_time_course/sample101/RNA/depleted.raw/
python /home1/03221/ucaglar/Ecoli_RNAseq/src/concatenate_reads.py /scratch/03221/ucaglar/data/glucose_time_course/sample102/RNA/depleted.raw/
...

then go to running center
cd /scratch/03221/ucaglar/data/runningCenter/
and run "concatenate_launcher.sge"
qsub /home1/03221/ucaglar/Ecoli_RNAseq/job_submissions_files/concatenate_launcher.sge 

if everything goes well you should generate *.processed folders under samples that includes files named

MURI_99_SA14008_TGACCA_L005+L006_001_R1.fastq
MURI_99_SA14008_TGACCA_L005+L006_001_R2.fastq

then the next step is to run the "write_paramlist_bowtie.sh" under $HOME/Ecoli_RNAseq/src
cd $HOME/Ecoli_RNAseq/src
./write_paramlist_bowtie.sh

if everything goes well you should see numbers from 1 to n
then a file named "paramlist_bowtie_glucose_time_course" should be generated under
$SCRATCH/data that looks like

...
/home1/03221/ucaglar/Ecoli_RNAseq/src/bowtie_commands.sh /scratch/03221/ucaglar/data/glucose_time_course/sample100/RNA/depleted.processed/
/home1/03221/ucaglar/Ecoli_RNAseq/src/bowtie_commands.sh /scratch/03221/ucaglar/data/glucose_time_course/sample101/RNA/depleted.processed/
/home1/03221/ucaglar/Ecoli_RNAseq/src/bowtie_commands.sh /scratch/03221/ucaglar/data/glucose_time_course/sample102/RNA/depleted.processed/
...

type
"module swap intel gcc"
to be able to run flexbar
you should download the flexbar also
note flexbar ver 2.31 works fine on the other hand ver 2.5 does not work

be sure that 
bowtie_launcher.sh is not in the test mode

then go to running center 
cd /scratch/03221/ucaglar/data/runningCenter/
and run "bowtie_launcher.sge"
qsub /home1/03221/ucaglar/Ecoli_RNAseq/job_submissions_files/bowtie_launcher.sge
